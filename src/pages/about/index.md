title: About Me
summary: 'Seven years ago, I managed to convince my employer that repairing tanks and making beds were transferable skills appropriate for a software business.'
---
I still work for that same employer, as part of [Headforwards](https://headforwards.com) Special Projects Division (SPD).

I'm a full stack software engineer with a background that gives me a unique perspective.
I have repaired tanks in the army, and designed digital electronics for the offshore oil and gas industry.
I entered the software industry when I built and managed the online presence of our boutique hostel, 
including a brand campaign that saw the hostel listed in national newspaper "top 10" lists, in-flight 
magazines, listed number six in the Sunday Times "Summer 100", and even included in "Amandaâ€™s Holiday Hotspots" for Reveal Magazine.

SPD work with a lot of "new" projects - either greenfield or new products - as result I have spent a 
lot of time with clients iterating over the problem: "what on earth do they really want!".
