First, find out about my first agile project (a loft conversion for our guesthouse in Newquay) and the lean principals I learned from "Mez the builder". This is a brief overview of the Agile principals (what good agile talk would be complete without it) without reading out loud the Agile Manifesto from a powerpoint slide.

Second, take a crash course in Behaviour Driven Development (BDD), and find out how Three Amigos can use deliberate discovery to "hear" what clients want. Deliberate discovery is a technique that can help uncover the boundaries and edge cases of an idea; I believe this is the essence of BDD (not tools, or frameworks), and the foundations of…

Finally, I share our team’s approach to client workshops that help them separate the "what" from the "how". We use three-steps - brain-dump, discovery, playback - and a mob of Amigos to answer the question "what on earth do they really want?".
