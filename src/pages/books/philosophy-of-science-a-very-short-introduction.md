summary: >-
  What is science? Is there a real difference between science and myth? Is
  science objective? Can science explain everything? This Very Short
  Introduction provides a concise overview of the main themes of contemporary
  philosophy of science. Beginning with a short history of science to set the
  scene, Samir Okasha goes on to investigate the nature of scientific reasoning,
  scientific explanation, revolutions in science, and theories such as realism
  and anti-realism. He also looks at philosophical issues in particular
  sciences, including the problem of classification in biology, and the nature
  of space and time in physics. The final chapter touches on the conflicts
  between science and religion, and explores whether science is ultimately a
  good thing.
