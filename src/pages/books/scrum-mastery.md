summary: >-
  he basics of being a ScrumMaster are fairly straightforward: At face value all
  a ScrumMaster needs to do is facilitate the Scrum process and remove
  impediments. But being a great ScrumMaster, one who truly embodies the
  principles of servant-leadership and helps move a team to the high performance
  levels possible with Scrum, is much harder and much more elusive. In this book
  Geoff shares a collection of stories and practical guidance, drawn from over
  ten years of coaching numerous Scrum teams that will guide you on your path to
  greatness.
