summary: >-
  Captain David Marquet was used to giving orders. In the high-stress
  environment of the USS Santa Fe, a nuclear-powered submarine, it was crucial
  his men did their job well. But the ship was dogged by poor morale, poor
  performance and the worst retention in the fleet.  One day, Marquet
  unknowingly gave an impossible order, and his crew tried to follow it anyway.
  He realized he was leading in a culture of followers, and they were all in
  danger unless they fundamentally changed the way they did things.
