summary: >-
  When Chris McDougall stumbled across the story of Churchill's 'dirty
  tricksters', a motley crew of English poets and academics who helped resist
  the Nazi invasion of Crete, he knew he was on the track of something special.
  To beat the odds, the tricksters-starving, aging, outnumbered-tapped into an
  ancient style of fitness: the lost art of heroism. They listened to their
  instincts, replaced calories with stored bodily fat and used their fascia, the
  network of tissue which criss-crosses the body, to catapult themselves to
  superhuman strength and endurance.
