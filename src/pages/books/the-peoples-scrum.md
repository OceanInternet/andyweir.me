When I practiced Tae-Kwon-Do, there were two schools Olympic sport of Tae-Kwon-Do, and the more purist Art of Tae-Kwon-Do. The Certified Scrums are more akin to Olympic TKD, whereas Tobias Mayer's Peoples' Scrum is closer to the more purist Art school of TKD - practiced for it's own sake rather than to meet some predefined criteria.
