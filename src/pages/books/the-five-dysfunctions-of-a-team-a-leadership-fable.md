summary: >-
  In The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Patrick Lencioni once again offers a
  leadership fable that is as enthralling and instructive as his first two
  best-selling books, The Five Temptations of a CEO and The Four Obsessions of
  an Extraordinary Executive. This time, he turns his keen intellect and
  storytelling power to the fascinating, complex world of teams.
